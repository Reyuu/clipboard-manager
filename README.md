# Clipboard manager

![Building](https://github.com/Reyuu/clipboard-manager/workflows/Building/badge.svg)

**Clipboard manager** is a simple utility that helps you with managing your clipboard. Say you need to copy and paste the same 2 things over and over but in different places (thus needing human attention), this will help you greatly.

It is intended for usage with **Windows**.

**[Latest release](https://github.com/Reyuu/clipboard-manager/releases/latest)**

|-|-|-|-|

### Disclaimer
